I thank you greatly for having read through the entirety of the book and hope that you enjoyed yourself whilst doing so. I have, to the best of my abilities, tried doing the original work justice, so that it can be both easily understood by the modern casual reader and appreciated by those who wish to more thoroughly study the original manuscripts, whilst still being faithful and true to the original.
