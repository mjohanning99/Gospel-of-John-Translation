			\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{he} Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His servants what must soon happen; and He made it known through the sending of His messenger to His servant John, who confirms everything that he saw, namely the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. Blessed is the reader and the people who listen to the words of the prophecy and (blessed is) the one who heeds what is written in it (the prophecy), for the time is near.
