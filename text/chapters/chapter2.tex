		\lettrine[lines=3]{A}{nd} on the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee and Jesus’ mother was there; and even Jesus and his disciples were called into (invited to) the wedding. And being without wine (running out of wine, wanting wine), Jesus’ mother says to him, “They do not have any wine.” And Jesus says to her, “My dear woman, what do we have to do with this (lit. what to me and to you)? My time has not yet come.” And his mother says to the waiters, “Do whatever he tells you to do!” There were six water jars made out of stone — for the cleansing of the Jews — standing (around) and they were able to hold approximately two or three measures (80 - 120 litres) (of liquid) each. And Jesus tells them, “Fill the jars with water!”; and they filled them completely. And he tells them, “Draw out (some water) now and carry it to the master of the feast.” And they carried it over; and as the master of the feast tasted the water, it turned into wine and he did not know where it came from — the waiters carrying the water, however, knew. The master of the feast then calls the bridegroom and tells him, “Everyone (usually) drinks the good wine and — when they are (sufficiently) drunk — they then drink the lesser wine. You, however, have kept the good wine up until now.” This marked the beginning of the miracles which Jesus (did) in Cana of Galilee and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.

		After this, Jesus, his mother, his brothers and his disciples went down to Capernaum and stayed there for a short time (lit. for not too many days). And the Jews’ feast of passover was near and (so) Jesus went up to Jerusalem; and he found in the (city’s) temple money changers and those which were selling cows (oxen), sheep and doves. And so, after making a whip out of a rope, he drove them all out of the temple — and the sheep and the oxen (as well). And he scattered the money changers’ coins and threw over their tables; and to those selling doves he said, “Take these things away from here; do not turn my Father’s house into a house of commerce!” And his disciples remembered that it is written that, “The zeal of your house consumes me (eats me up)”.

		The Jews, then, answered and said, “What sign are you showing us by doing this?” Jesus answered them and said, “Destroy this temple and within three days, I shall re-erect it!” And the Jews said, “This temple was in construction for forty-six years; and you will re-erect it in three days?” He, however, spoke of the temple of his body — so that when he rose from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this and believed in both the scripture and the words which Jesus spoke.  And as he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the passover, many believed in his name (after) seeing the signs he did. But Jesus did not entrust himself to them; for he knows every (person) and did not need anyone to testify of mankind — for he knew what was within mankind.
